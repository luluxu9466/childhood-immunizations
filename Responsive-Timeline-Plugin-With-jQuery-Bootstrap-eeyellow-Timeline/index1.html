                                            Prognosis: <br>Most people survive measles, though in some cases,
                                            complications may occur. <br>About 1 in 4 individuals will be hospitalized
                                            and 1–2 in 1000 will die. <br>Complications are more likely in children
                                            under age 5 and adults over age 20.</p>
